Bunny is a utility written in Python that provides an interactive shell for
issuing commands to an AMQP server. It uses (and depends on) amqplib, an AMQP
client library written in Python.

Running 'bunny.py' with no arguments will get you into a shell where the first
thing you'll need to do is issue the 'connect' command, which will prompt you
for connection details. 

If you're stuck, run 'help' from within the shell, or "help <command>", or
"?". 

Note that if readline is available, command history and completion should
work. On my test machine (a mac), history works and completion doesn't. 

TODO: 
=========
Bunny is good for functionally testing creation and deletion of queues and
creation of bindings. I'd like to add tests for sending and receiving
messages before releasing it to the public.

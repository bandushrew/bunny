Bunny is a utility written in Python that provides an interactive shell for
issuing commands to an AMQP server. It uses (and depends on) amqplib, an AMQP
client library written in Python.

Running 'bunny.py' with no arguments will get you into a shell where the first
thing you'll need to do is issue the 'connect' command, which will prompt you
for connection details. 

If you're stuck, run 'help' from within the shell, or "help <command>", or
"?". 

Note that if readline is available, command history and completion should
work. On my test machine (a mac), history works and completion doesn't. 

TODO: 
=========
Bunny is good for functionally testing creation and deletion of queues and
creation of bindings. It can also do basic message send/receive testing, 
and it can purge a queue of all messages you threw in there during your tests :) 

This is not to say that the features are necessarily robust. Assumptions are made 
that dictate, in some instances, that you do things in the most simplistic way allowable. 
That said, it should be trivial to enhance bunny, and the only thing in the way of that 
being done is that the itch isn't there (yet).
